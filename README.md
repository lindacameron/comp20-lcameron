# Finalizing Learning Portfolio

## Purpose of this Git Repository
The purpose of this Git repository is to hold all of the work/assignments done for COMP20 in an easy to access place. 

## Favorite lab/assignment
My favorite assignment was Assignment 2 (Historic Landmarks). Using geolocation and making a post request for the first time was pretty neat, especially since I use apps and websites that do both of these things every day and I had never really thought into how any of it was done. So I really loved learning about all of that. Also, this assignment was somewhat challenging at times, but I was able to do all of it on my own which was very rewarding. I also enjoyed using the google maps API!

## How much have I grown?
Considering that I had no idea what an HTML file was or how the internet worked on day one, I think I have grown and learned a lot through this class. 

## Most important thing learned
How the web/internet works. Before taking this class I thought the internet was this magical thing that gave me information I needed and that it just worked as long as there was wifi. I never thought into everything else that could go into how the web works, and I guess this was quite naive of me, but I have really learned a great deal. It all makes sense now! And I'm very glad I have this new understanding about how it works. This knowledge has become quite helpful in hackathons/other projects that I am working on.
Now I understand why certain features of the sites I use do/do not work, and it is really interesting to be able to understand and learn. (I use adblocker and listen to spotify on the web, and now I have a better understanding of why it glitches all the time, and also how adblocker works!)


## What do I want to delve deeper into?
I would like learn more javaScript (and become much better at using it), and I would like to learn much more MongoDB and other database programs. I also want to learn much much more about security!
